☝️ _Note: If you look closely, you’ll notice a custom admin colour scheme in the screenshot. It is not packaged with this plugin as it is part of [Altis, an open-source WordPress digital experience platform](https://www.altis-dxp.com/docs/)._

✅ This plugin minimises the WordPress admin menu into five (5) top-level items.<br>
✅ It also remixes submenus and adds some former top-level items to them.<br>
✅ On top of it all, it bundles all third-party settings pages on a dedicated custom page that is accessible via the _Setup_ top-level menu item.
